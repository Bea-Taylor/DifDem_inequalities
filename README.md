## Description

It has been reported that geography and depravation levels affect
diagnosis, with [different rates of dementia diagnosis in different
areas of the UK](https://dementiastatistics.org/about-dementia/maps/).
Discussions about inequality in Dementia diagnosis and treatment are a
current priority for both the Alzheimer’s Society and the [All-Party
Parliamentary
Groups](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/policy-and-influencing/all-party-parliamentary-group-dementia).
This work is inspired by the 2021 Alzheimer’s society report into
[Regional variation: increasing access to a dementia
diagnosis](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-09/regional_variations_increasing_access_to_diagnosis.pdf).

Rates of dementia diagnosis depend on both the prevalence of dementia in
an area, and a GP practices ability to detect and report new cases.
Dementia prevalence is itself affected by risk factors including: age,
sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, and modifiable lifestyle
factors. This has been reported in the literature with:

- [Higher rates of diagnosis in more deprived
  areas](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/primary-health-care-research-and-development/article/variations-in-dementia-diagnosis-in-england-and-association-with-general-practice-characteristics/18A64D2EF4CBEC49874B343C1B41D651),
  possibly due to higher rate of other health conditions leading to more
  frequent GP appointments.
- [Lower rates of diagnosis in more deprived
  areas](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12877-022-03086-4)
- Lower rates of diagnosis in more rural areas, due to difficulty
  physically attending GP practises/clinics.
- [Lower rates of diagnosis in single-handed GP
  practises](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21777080/) (practise with a
  single doctor) - which in turn are [correlated with more deprived
  areas.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13558196231218830)

Depravation levels also affect prevalence.

- Higher rates of prevalence due to socio-economic modifiable risk
  factors (such as level of education).
- Lower rates of prevalence due to higher rate of comorbidities, which
  result in fewer people living to older age (age is the largest risk
  factor for dementia).

Previous studies have also found a correlation between deprivation and
the amount of anti-dementia drugs being precribed:

- [Lower rates of anti-dementia drug prescribing in more deprived
  areas.](https://watermark.silverchair.com/afv154.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAA6cwggOjBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggOUMIIDkAIBADCCA4kGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMqDMkBZkmAQ5-UhZIAgEQgIIDWipSED6hj8nfaYU-FjySfvP076ox9BMYagpe0Do8Zpz-mYd-choLiPCIly_yphlr3hRisgyWvfWI9sDvgXf8kJwDUZZJepnz7KK6IDxlpQouejPaSWtHvdiexSaoxaAfnbmX5k2t28Cg16fEpXZcyu2CT-ldkvIWVL0cYbeeUQcYAKw5Lh_-k_7fHbe4dLc6XzxdPl57T8bGWFUmlF7J0LRg4gLbZSfdOWxuZHZvTJCGOYRgbD2uUbNvBH8xtE7o44_nF_ZmP6-JBIRvEaTdgbCYkR4XE8EmTO96npiS3h1O3U5DjmJMl6OzXOApussCm4SWnbnBtu-MAC41mgfKdcAlPmlv7Tq_A9aoIoUK_ryQSee69ciHZvFrNLxTMoRwH1UnzSm_2x_0OvESS4kxBvg5-wXEYOVI7i6saQbRxJdBitv9LCfGiM7hRxkZzZ4zgOBHP_FQvy4sWkQSoFbHauymos1E-Ud9WVlk5oc_8eSD7uj1V9EykNbqxjGWixmx-MIwqCQ5tapWDwS87D6KxWk29NljqLiNX6A3LFBQOptgg7bdfeOt2ev6skT5vef2fS5zPLpg6Ld3lU_nMaNs_QUXuIy7M8SSEZGYrq1X__cr3mqVCHqECtzkBEpRYLuxUQsf2XAQyYf4hcx257aC3yzdgxRs79R1ZywDt6dCLaZjK3EpEeA06ijtrAW3ewu975geNmys-pyhLut2uVVixOgyZxAFjLD-sEqmWv0bvtLcn2IYs89FCRevAt-h4JBXjaoSBg1pt35fyEF6eKFFl6PAYQ9JnUkZHmh3VVM0pBNzVf_ur9DLa3so8Uym6-K6niRoBBGAjpHWKC728ZcL4HmANYk1V9JfOblDkXaEuo0XW4klXtZO6xAmcRh4hSt-VIhXu14NW1UylrxMSrEwNCM8gDItY4ngWwzaZtdP1hBtLuYGImTmevHpuZ0__mDQTWAOIeJxSvDJB5eVvr--zIh9kv7X1vSZqZtvEq0vAxSUSQuUspMpFOUKwW-fUCv3C-v0SH2vKAG4plch2QsXZQZr6u3k1AXkNNA7fnORbrVDPyxpgICF6D_vZbHAymL5-0jgs5eGhirwkm9qYHQNOdlwX1NuSQG6_rRi2E_wZLaz6D4W6NVU5oVaCg)
