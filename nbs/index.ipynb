    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been reported that geography and depravation levels affect individiuals chance of recieving a dementia diagnsis, with [different rates of dementia diagnosis in different areas of the UK](https://dementiastatistics.org/about-dementia/maps/). Understanding and addressing these types of inquality is a current priority for both the Alzheimerâ€™s Society  and the [All-Party Parliamentary Groups](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/policy-and-influencing/all-party-parliamentary-group-dementia). This work is inspired by the 2021 Alzheimer's society report into [Regional variation: increasing access to a dementia diagnosis](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-09/regional_variations_increasing_access_to_diagnosis.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "Rates of dementia diagnosis depend on both the prevalence of dementia in an area, and a GP practices ability to detect and report new cases. Dementia prevalence is itself affected by risk factors including: age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, and modifiable lifestyle factors. This has been reported in the literature with: \n",
    "\n",
    "- [Higher rates of diagnosis in more deprived areas](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/primary-health-care-research-and-development/article/variations-in-dementia-diagnosis-in-england-and-association-with-general-practice-characteristics/18A64D2EF4CBEC49874B343C1B41D651), possibly due to higher rate of other health conditions leading to more frequent GP appointments.\n",
    "- [Lower rates of diagnosis in more deprived areas](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12877-022-03086-4)\n",
    "- Lower rates of diagnosis in more rural areas, due to difficulty physically attending GP practises/clinics.\n",
    "- [Lower rates of diagnosis in single-handed GP practises](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21777080/) (practise with a single doctor) - which in turn are [correlated with more deprived areas.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13558196231218830)\n",
    "\n",
    "Depravation levels can also affect prevalence with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Higher rates of prevalence due to socio-economic modifiable risk factors (such as level of education).\n",
    "- Lower rates of prevalence due to higher rate of comorbidities, which result in fewer people living to older age (age is the largest risk factor for dementia).\n",
